# Glow JS

Here is a set of packages that you can use to integrate Glow onto your dApp:

- `packages/glow-client` - this gives you a `GlowClient` instance which interacts with the Glow Chrome Extension
- `packages/glow-react` - this gives you a React Context provider `<GlowProvider />` that makes it easy to integrate Glow with React
- `packages/example-next-js` - this is a Next.js example which [you can see deployed here](https://glow-js.luma-dev.com/)
