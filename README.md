## Packages 

Here is a set of packages that you can use to integrate Glow onto your dApp:

- `@glow-xyz/glow-client` - this gives you a `GlowClient` instance which interacts with the Glow Chrome Extension
- `@glow-xyz/glow-react` - this gives you a React Context provider `<GlowProvider />` that makes it easy to integrate Glow with React
- `@glow-xyz/example-next-js` - this is a Next.js example which [you can see deployed here](https://glow-js.luma-dev.com/)

We have made this as easy as possible, so you should be able to integrate Glow into your dApp in under 10 minutes.
